You are a **Senior Full Stack Software Engineer (SDE-3)** building a **modern, competition-grade online quiz platform** with a **2030-style UI inspired by 21st.dev**.

This is **not an admin-driven system**.
All quiz content is **JSON-based**, preloaded or fetched from a secure endpoint.

The product must feel:

* Ultra-modern
* Smooth
* Minimal
* High-trust
* Premium (startup-grade)

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

A **single-attempt, timed competitive quiz web app** where:

* Users authenticate via Google
* Quiz questions are loaded from structured JSON
* The quiz experience is immersive, animated, and distraction-free
* Results and leaderboard are auto-generated

Think **Vercel + Linear + Raycast UI quality**, not a college project.

---

## 🧩 Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Attempt Control

* Google Authentication only
* One Google account = one quiz attempt (hard lock)
* Attempt state must persist across refresh, reconnect, or accidental close
* No admin overrides, no reset UI
* Once submitted or terminated → permanently locked

---

### 2. JSON-Driven Quiz Engine (No Admin Panel)

* Quiz questions are loaded from a **static or remote JSON file**
* JSON schema supports:

  * Question ID
  * Type:

    * MCQ (single correct)
    * MCQ (multiple correct)
    * True / False
    * Code output (optional)
  * Options
  * Correct answer(s)
  * Difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)
  * Optional explanation
* Validate JSON at runtime
* Graceful fallback if JSON is malformed

---

### 3. Timed Quiz Flow

* Timer starts only after user clicks **“Start Quiz”**
* Sticky floating timer with subtle animation
* Auto-submit on timeout
* Confirmation modal before manual submit
* Save answers incrementally (every change)

---

### 4. Anti-Cheat (Soft but Effective)

* Randomized question order per user
* Randomized option order per question
* Detect tab switch / window blur:

  * First 2 times → animated warning toast
  * 3rd time → auto-submit + lock
* Disable copy/paste where feasible
* Prevent reload abuse using persisted state

---

### 5. Evaluation & Scoring

* Auto-evaluate on submit or timeout
* Score formula:

  * Accuracy
  * Time taken (weighted)
* Tie-breakers:

  1. Higher score
  2. Higher accuracy
  3. Lower time taken
* Evaluation must be deterministic and reproducible

---

### 6. Leaderboard

* Auto-generated from attempts
* Display:

  * Rank
  * Name
  * Score
  * Accuracy %
  * Time taken
* Smooth animated rank transitions
* Final leaderboard freezes after quiz end

---

## 🎨 UI / UX (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

Design language:

* **21st.dev / 2030 UI**
* Glassmorphism / soft gradients
* Floating cards with depth
* Subtle motion everywhere (but never distracting)

UI requirements:

* Card-based layout
* Animated transitions between questions
* Progress indicator with micro-interactions
* Framer Motion–style easing
* Mobile-first, thumb-friendly
* Dark mode default (with optional light mode)

Avoid:

* Clutter
* Heavy borders
* Cheap gradients
* Bootstrap-style layouts

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Strict)

**Frontend**

* Next.js (App Router)
* Tailwind CSS
* Framer Motion
* shadcn/ui or equivalent modern primitives

**Backend**

* Node.js + lightweight API routes
* Secure evaluation logic (no client trust)

**Database**

* Firebase / MongoDB
* Collections:

  * Users
  * Attempts
  * Leaderboard

**Auth**

* Firebase Google Auth

**Hosting**

* Vercel (Frontend)
* Serverless or Render (Backend)

---

## 🧱 Engineering Standards

* Clean folder structure
* Modular components
* Strong typing (TypeScript preferred)
* Defensive programming
* Edge-case safe (refresh, timeout, disconnect)
* Production-quality comments only where needed

---

## 📦 Required Outputs

1. High-level architecture
2. JSON schema for questions
3. API design
4. Frontend component hierarchy
5. Anti-cheat logic explanation
6. Scoring algorithm
7. UI animation strategy
8. Deployment checklist

Build this like a **real startup product**, not a demo.
Every decision should optimize for **fairness, polish, and trust**.
